Kanye West's chilling words to wife Bianca Censori before she bared all on the Grammys red carpet have been revealed. The pair shocked the world on Sunday night when model and designer Bianca dropped her coat to expose her body in nude mesh.

Kanye, 47, was heard whispering to his partner moments before the risque reveal. Bianca, 30, slowly dropped her coat to flash her bum before turning around for the cameras - while keeping a straight face throughout the stunt.

There were claims the pair had been escorted from the awards following the incident. A lipreader has now revealed their bizarre interaction that took place in the moments before Bianca stripped, the Mirror reports.

The pair were seen talking on the red carpet in a now viral video posted to TikTok. According to Nicola Hickling, the founder and lead analyst at LipReader, West was telling his wife to take off her coat and reveal all.

According to Hickling, Kanye gave his wife five words of praise before things took a turn. "You're making a scene now," Kanye tells her as the photographers begin to snap their arrival. Bianca then silently nods her head.
